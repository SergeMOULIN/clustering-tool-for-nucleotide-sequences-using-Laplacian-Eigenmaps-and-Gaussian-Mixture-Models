# Clustering tool for nucleotide sequences using Laplacian Eigenmaps and Gaussian Mixture Models

This repository is related to the article: "A clustering tool for nucleotide sequences using Laplacian Eigenmaps and Gaussian Mixture Models" (article in submission).

The "gclust.py" file contains the function "gclust" which process the steps 2 and 3 discribed in the article (i.e. Laplacian eigenmaps and GMM). In other words, gclust receives in input a similarity matrix and return the clustering.
